This is an simple flashcard-style application to help me learn French.

Specifically, I'd like to build from basic sentence structures, testing my knowledge of verb tenses, noun cases, prepositions, adjective / adverb usage, etc.

Technically, I'd like to use the React / Redux / Node stack.

Also, I'd like to convert it to ES2015 at some point.

TODO:
- [ ] Modularize the `entry.jsx` file into multiple files
- [ ] Rewrite using ES2015
- [ ] Write a Node / Express backend
