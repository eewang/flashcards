This is an simple flashcard-style application to help me learn French.

Specifically, I'd like to build from basic sentence structures, testing my knowledge of verb tenses, noun cases, prepositions, adjective / adverb usage, etc.

Technically, I'd like to use the React / Redux / Relay / Node stack.
